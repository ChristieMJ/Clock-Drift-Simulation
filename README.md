# ClockDriftSim: Monte Carlo Simulation for Vacuum-Induced Frequency Drifts in Atomic Clocks

This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation in Python to model vacuum-induced frequency drifts in cesium (NIST-F2) and Al\(^+\) ion clocks, along with visuals from the associated research paper *"Probing Vacuum-Induced Clock Drifts via Quantum Metrology: A Testable Hypothesis"* (Jansson, 2025, DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.15163879](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15163879)).

## Overview
`updated_time_sim.py` simulates frequency drifts in atomic clocks due to vacuum fluctuations, testing noise levels (\(\eta = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001\)) corresponding to vacuum pressures (\(10^{-8}\) to \(10^{-12}\) Pa). The script generates fractional frequency drifts (\(\Delta f/f\)) to explore vacuum fluctuation effects at the \(10^{-18}\) s scale, producing console output and a graph (Figure 3). The repository also includes additional figures from the paper: an experimental setup schematic (Figure 1) and a bar chart comparing simulated vs. real-world drifts (Figure 2).

## Repository Structure
- `updated_time_sim.py`: The main Python script for the Monte Carlo simulation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries.
- `figures/`: Contains visuals:
  - `Figure_1_Experimental_Setup_Schematic.png`: Schematic of the proposed experimental setup (from the paper).
  - `Figure_2_Simulated_vs_Real_Drift_Bar_Chart.png`: Bar chart comparing simulated and real-world drifts (from the paper).
  - `Figure_3_Cesium_vs_Ion_Graph.png`: Graph of mean drifts vs. noise levels (generated by the script).

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`):
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - pandas

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/ChristieMJ/Clock-Drift-Sim.git
cd Clock-Drift-Sim
2. Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Verify the installation:
python -c import numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas 
print('All libraries installed successfully')

## Usage
1. Run the script:
python updated_time_sim.py

2. The script will:
- Simulate frequency drifts for cesium and ion clocks.
- Output results to the console (mean drifts, standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals).
- Save a graph (Figure 3) in the `ClockData` directory (default: `C:\Users\chris\Documents\ClockData`).

## Example Outputs
The following visuals are included in the repository:

### Figure 1: Experimental Setup Schematic
This schematic (from the paper) illustrates the proposed setup for measuring vacuum-induced frequency drifts, including an ultra-high vacuum chamber, mu-metal shielding, and a Ti:sapphire frequency comb.

### Figure 2: Simulated vs. Real-World Drift Comparison
This bar chart (from the paper) compares simulated fractional frequency drifts (from the script) with real-world data for cesium and ion clocks.

### Figure 3: Mean Drifts vs. Noise Levels
This graph is generated by `updated_time_sim.py`, plotting mean drifts for cesium and ion clocks across noise levels.

## Notes
- **Output Directory**: The script saves the graph to `C:\Users\chris\Documents\ClockData` by default. Modify the `output_dir` variable in `updated_time_sim.py` to change this.
- **Reproducibility**: The script uses a random seed (`np.random.seed(42)`) for consistent results.
- **.gitignore**: The `ClockData` directory is excluded from version control to avoid tracking dynamically generated files.
- **Figures 1 and 2**: These are static figures from the paper, not generated by the script, included here for context.
